   <h2>Apache HTTP Server</h2>
 <p>For our project, we will utilize Apache HTTP Server, more commonly referred to as simply, Apache. The name being a pun on the words "A PAtCHy server".  Apache is a popular open-source software for hosting web servers. The fact that Apache is open-source is one of major reasons for why Apache has become the widely-used powerhouse that it is today. Apache is also notable for being efficient, highly stable, fast, and is supported across many platforms including Linux, Windows and OSX. </p>
<p>You may ask, just how big does the Apache empire span? Well, during the last Web Server Survey conducted by Netcraft, in August of 2018, Apache was estimated to serve a whopping 39% of all active websites; Compared to the second highest, which was Nginx with 23% of all active websites - this is rather impressive.</p>
 <p>Apache was created in early 1995 after the prevailing popular web server NCSA began slowing it’s development. A small amount of webmasters who needed a replacement for NCSA came together and began communicating together,  forming a mailing list to shared information. In a relatively short span of time, eight of the contributors formed the foundation of the Apache Group. This foundation would later go on to become Apache Software Foundation, a non-profit corporation, whose sole goal is the development and maintenance of Apache products.
The fact that Apache is not only free, but also has commercial support from the Apache Software Foundation has prominently built an enticement to web hosts and companies. This early popularity allowed Apache to cause a explosion in the initial growth of the World Wide Web were it would quickly become the dominant choice when companies were looking for ways to host their web servers.</p>
