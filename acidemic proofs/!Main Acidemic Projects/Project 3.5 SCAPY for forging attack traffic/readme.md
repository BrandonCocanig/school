# CS 42700 Project 3.5: SCAPY for forging attack traffic
<Brandon Cocanig>

# project 3.5
A simple proof of concept of loading and using Scapy to construct "fake" traffic that resembles buffer overflow attacks in progress.

## notes
This code does work but serves no purpose other than to trigger an alert system on another system in order to disguise actual intrusion attempts.
